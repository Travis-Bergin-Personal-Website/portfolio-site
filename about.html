    <div class="me">About Me <br>
        I am a 31 year old Veteran and former Firefighter/Paramedic. I recently left my firefighting career to start pursuing a career in the very fast growing tech field. I have always been interested in computers and how they work. I am very excited for this new adventure and look forward to beginning a new career.

        My favorite place to snowboard is called Wolf Creek in Pagosa Springs, Colorado! <br> I have been around 6 times and I like to believe I have gotten pretty good.
