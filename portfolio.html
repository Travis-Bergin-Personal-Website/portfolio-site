        I served in the United States Marine Corps for four years. I deployed to Afghanistan and Australia during my time. <br> <br>
        
        In Afghanistan, we were sent to retrograde one of the largest operational bases, Camp Leatherneck. Our job was to keep track of passengers and cargo. My platoon and I moved over five million  pounds of cargo and 2000 passengers. <br><br>
        In Australia our main goal was to train and interact with the Australian military. We did this by going out to their “training sites” also known as the “outback”. We spent weeks at a time training in the field with the Australian military, getting to know their policies and procedures during training ops. 
        Also in Australia, we got to explore parts of the area we were in on our off time. We were in the Northern Territory and got to explore the city life, night life, and even some of their national parks.

        After my time in the Marine Corps, I became a firefighter/paramedic. I was a firefighter for almost five years. I enjoyed my time, but ultimately made the decision that I didn’t want to see the things I already had and other things I had the potential to see for the next 25 to 30 years. Helping people has always been in my nature, but mental health and happiness for myself became more important to me. <br><br>

        The decision to leave the Fire Department has led me to where I am now. Pursuing a job as a software developer. I am extremely excited to start this new journey in my life and can’t wait to see what my future holds!
